# Installation

**How much time does it take to install this. ? **

It takes about 20 - 30 minutes. It depends on how many people's birthday you want to display on your dashboard. But remember, you only do it once. ðŸŽ‰

**How do I install this theme?**

This not a python or anything else coded software but just a code. 

**This is hard because I don't have any code knowledge.**

Don't worry. I have a manual for setup. Everything is explained there and it is super easy to install. 

**Where are the codes ? **

Everything you need including the setup manual is in this page. ðŸŽ‰

**I don't have the multimedia files you used. ? **

For this project you do not need any multimedia files. Because it is a birthday card you have to create your own. Instructions are in the manual. ðŸŽ‰
## Page Properties:

- Displays 4 upcoming birthdays. The number can also be increased further with the help of a swiper card

## Before we start, we need some third party tools from Hacs:
